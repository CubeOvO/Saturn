# Saturn
First Year Project - investigate Photodetachment rate at Saturn


A significant surprise of the Cassini mission was the discovery of negatively charged
ions (O-, OH-, H2O-) in the plumes of Enceladus. So far from the Sun, a reduced
solar photon flux means these molecules gain hang onto their excess electron for
much longer than at the Earth. But how long do these molecules exist for? If the
answer is sufficiently long they might be transported far away from where they are
produced and therefore could also be found in many other locations around Saturn.
This project will build upon the wave physics, maths and python programming skills
you will have learnt in your first year. You will take the solar spectrum as a function
of wavelength, and perform a simple calculation involving particles cross-sections to
deduce a reaction rate. Cassini measurements will provide the inputs to your
calculations and subsequent steps could involve building a basic model of the
production and loss rates.
